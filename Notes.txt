Comparison operation values
In C#, these values are represented by the Rendering.CompareFunction enum.

Value	Corresponding integer value in Rendering.CompareFunction enum	Function
Never	1	Never render pixels.
Less	2	Render pixels when their reference value is less than the current value in the stencil buffer.
Equal	3	Render pixels when their reference value is equal to the current value in the stencil buffer.
LEqual	4	Render pixels when their reference value is less than or equal to the current value in the stencil buffer.
Greater	5	Render pixels when their reference value is greater than the current value in the stencil buffer.
NotEqual	6	Render pixels when their reference value differs from the current value in the stencil buffer.
GEqual	7	Render pixels when their reference value is greater than or equal to the current value in the stencil buffer.
Always	8	Always render pixels.

Stencil operation values
In C#, these values are represented by the Rendering.Rendering.StencilOp enum.

Value	Corresponding integer value in Rendering.StencilOp enum	Function
Keep	0	Keep the current contents of the stencil buffer.
Zero	1	Write 0 into the stencil buffer.
Replace	2	Write the reference value into the buffer.
IncrSat	3	Increment the current value in the buffer. If the value is 255 already, it stays at 255.
DecrSat	4	Decrement the current value in the buffer. If the value is 0 already, it stays at 0.
Invert	5	Negate all the bits of the current value in the buffer.
IncrWrap	6	Increment the current value in the buffer. If the value is 255 already, it becomes 0.
DecrWrap	7	Decrement the current value in the buffer. If the value is 0 already, it becomes 255.
