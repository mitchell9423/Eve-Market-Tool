EXAMPLE USE
Let's take a look at a simple example of using python's requests module to download the ESI spec. But again, just to reiterate, this concept works on every ESI route.

>>> import requests
>>> spec_url = "https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/swagger.json"
>>> esi_spec = requests.get(spec_url)
>>> esi_spec.status_code
200
>>> len(esi_spec.content)
921525
>>> esi_spec.headers["ETag"]
'"09f8b2541e00231360e70eb9d4d6e6504a298f9c8336277c704509a8"'
>>> etag = esi_spec.headers["ETag"]
As you can see, we just downloaded 921525 bytes (after uncompressing) to get a 200 OK response from ESI which came with a strong ETag response header. Assuming you stored this ETag somewhere (we just saved it to etag above), you could use it in the future:

>>> esi_spec_change = requests.get(spec_url, headers={"If-None-Match": etag})
>>> esi_spec_change.status_code
304
>>> len(esi_spec_change.content)
0
We know with the second request the content hasn't changed since the first time, so we can keep using the first response we received. This saves us the transfer bandwidth, uncompressing, and JSON loading this response again.

Comparison operation values
In C#, these values are represented by the Rendering.CompareFunction enum.

Value	Corresponding integer value in Rendering.CompareFunction enum	Function
Never	1	Never render pixels.
Less	2	Render pixels when their reference value is less than the current value in the stencil buffer.
Equal	3	Render pixels when their reference value is equal to the current value in the stencil buffer.
LEqual	4	Render pixels when their reference value is less than or equal to the current value in the stencil buffer.
Greater	5	Render pixels when their reference value is greater than the current value in the stencil buffer.
NotEqual	6	Render pixels when their reference value differs from the current value in the stencil buffer.
GEqual	7	Render pixels when their reference value is greater than or equal to the current value in the stencil buffer.
Always	8	Always render pixels.

Stencil operation values
In C#, these values are represented by the Rendering.Rendering.StencilOp enum.

Value	Corresponding integer value in Rendering.StencilOp enum	Function
Keep	0	Keep the current contents of the stencil buffer.
Zero	1	Write 0 into the stencil buffer.
Replace	2	Write the reference value into the buffer.
IncrSat	3	Increment the current value in the buffer. If the value is 255 already, it stays at 255.
DecrSat	4	Decrement the current value in the buffer. If the value is 0 already, it stays at 0.
Invert	5	Negate all the bits of the current value in the buffer.
IncrWrap	6	Increment the current value in the buffer. If the value is 255 already, it becomes 0.
DecrWrap	7	Decrement the current value in the buffer. If the value is 0 already, it becomes 255.
